# Inverted-Index-With-SQLite

Simple search engine emulator using the TF-IDF indexing scheme. This project about implementing an inverted index using a relational database (e.g. SQLite) and Java. The idea is to use the B-Tree data structure offered by a relational database instead of building it from the scratch.

Implementation based on “Using a Relational Database for an Inverted Text Index” by Steve Putz
